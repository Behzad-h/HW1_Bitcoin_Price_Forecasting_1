## Bitcoin Price Forecasting-1: Simple Linear Regression Model


In this project, we build a simple forecasting model based on the linear regression for the Bitcoin 'Close' prices extracted from the 'Yahoo Finance' repository. The target variable is the 1-day ahead value (daily value) of Bitcoin and the inputs of the model are the historical values (n lags) of the target variable (autoregressive modeling).
